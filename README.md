# demo-roulette
Randomly clones a Meteor Repository, starts it, and opens the source code in your editor

## Setup

Copy the `example-repositories.json` file and rename it `repositories.json`.  Add your own repositories following the format of the example file.

## Usage

Run `roulette.sh`.  

## Why node?

This tool was written for a class learning Node.js.  Otherwise I would have just used a shell script.
